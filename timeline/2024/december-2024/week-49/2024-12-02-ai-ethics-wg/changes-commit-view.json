        "narrative": "Tasks on Github\nWe started by going through tasks “in progress”;\nWe went through Q4 Interviews updates. Duke said he has done 3 interviews so far and will wrap up the remaining 7 before we go for holiday this quarter. Clement, Ayo and Kenichi are done with their Q3 interviews. AdvancedAmeyaw has done 3 so far and is looking to finish his Q4 interviews by the 7th of December. Onize is done with her Q4 interviews, Ese’s interviews for Q3 and Q4 are progressing just fine. We are not moving interviews “in progress” to “done” yet until the validity of the interviews has been confirmed (listening to at least part of them to check audibility, clarity, relevance, length all conform to the validity criteria) by Esther, LeeLoo and Vani.\n\nModeration of the AI Ethics forum: Clement is doing fine here, nothing dramatic yet lol. He will be asked to write an update in the issue itself on how it's gone this Quarter.\n\nPre-AGI-24 roundtable and AGI-24 Chillout rooms rewards: These payments will not go through the Ambassador program Treasury system after all but will come directly from the Foundation via  the Supervisory Council's budget. Esther reached out to the Foundation's financial operations team, and rewards are supposed to go out this week. Leeloo will reach out to her for confirmation. The issue will remain open till it's resolved and paid.\n\nAdmin Team Roles: WG Internal Management, WG Async Support, Co-chair and Community Manager have all given updates on what they have been doing, s these issues can be closed and sent for payment.\n\nAI Ethics Events: We are looking to meet before the end of this quarter to discuss in a session what kind of events (virtual & physical) the Ambassador Program should attend next year.\n\nDocumenting BeGIN meetings: we will not be doing this next Quarter. Onize will upload any that she has done, and will update the issue on the github board.\n\nWe went onto tasks in “to-do”;\nSucre isn't doing Q4 Interviews anymore, Ese will get to hers soon.\nHow long should we keep Q3 interviews open? Especially the ones still in “to-do”. CollyPride and LadyTempestt suggested the end of the year or before we all go on holiday. CallyFromAuron suggested we wait till Q1, 2025 and if there are people with Q3 interviews that are yet to be done, and other people interested in doing interviews in Quarter 1 then we should reallocate budget.\nWe will look at producing educational resources to demystify basic AI Ethics terminology & ideas, and rewarding people who attended the training session for interviewing skills again in early Q1 if we have extra budget (which will depend on AGIX price). \n\n\nWe also went through our Q1 2025 budget items: We will assign some specific items to people at the beginning of January or our first meeting next year. Colleen, Ese showed interest in this budget item “ideation on how to get donors”. Onize, Duke, and possibly Stephen are interested in Knowledge Management and Data Analysis. If AGIX goes up we might be able to start doing some transcription in Q1 (using ReadAI and edited by the interviewers) but if not, this will begin in Q2 2024.\n\nWe also went through and finalized our Q4 report.\n\nSurvey Sharing: We have tested the survey and so far it just needs some small tweaks so it can go out. Esther is working on these, but it might not be ready before the end of the quarter.",
